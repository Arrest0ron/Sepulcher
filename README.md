## Live Demo
- Visit **https://arrest0ron.github.io/Sepulcher/** to summon the spider instantly.

## Features
- **Procedural locomotion** – IK-driven legs with adaptive swing arcs keep the spider grounded and creepy.
- **Ghostly ambience** – layered gradients, glow trails, and a sigil signature set a sepulchral mood.
- **Bone cursor** – a custom skeletal pointer replaces the system cursor for extra unease.
- **Speed control** – a minimalist slider lets you tune how aggressively the spider hunts your pointer.

## Usage
1. Open the [live demo](https://arrest0ron.github.io/Sepulcher/) or clone the repository locally.
2. If running locally, open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Move the cursor to watch the spider pursue it; adjust the bottom-right slider to change pursuit speed.

## Controls
- **Speed Slider** – drag left/right to decrease or increase the spider’s chase velocity.
